## Important!

This is a development version of the [**Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis
with Bioconductor**](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/) [@OMA] book from the
the [*miaverse*](https://microbiome.github.io). 

:::

You are reading the online book, [**Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis
with Bioconductor**](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/) [@OMA], where we
walk through common strategies and workflows in microbiome data
science.

The book shows through concrete examples how you can take advantage of
the latest developments in R/Bioconductor for the manipulation,
analysis, and reproducible reporting of hierarchical and heterogeneous
microbiome profiling data sets. The book was borne out of necessity,
while updating microbiome analysis tools to work with Bioconductor
classes that provide support for multi-modal data collections. Many of
these techniques are generic and widely applicable in other contexts
as well.

This work has been heavily influenced by other similar resources, in
particular the Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor
[@Amezquita2020], [phyloseq
tutorials](http://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/tutorials-index)
[@Callahan2016] and [microbiome
tutorials](https://microbiome.github.io/tutorials/) [@Shetty2019].
This book extends these resources to teach the grammar of Bioconductor
workflows in the context of microbiome data science.  As such, it
supports the adoption of general skills in the analysis of large,
hierarchical, and multi-modal data collections. We focus on microbiome
analysis tools, including entirely new, partially updated as well as
previously established methods.

This online resource and its associated ecosystem of microbiome data
science tools are a result of a community-driven development process,
and welcoming new contributors. Several individuals have
[contributed](https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/graphs/contributors)
methods, workflows and improvements as acknowledged in the
Introduction. You can find more information on how to find us online
and join the developer community through the project homepage at
[microbiome.github.io](https://microbiome.github.io). This online
resource has been written in Quarto with the BiocBook package [@serizay2023].

We assume that the reader is already familiar with R programming. For
references and tips on introductory material for R and Bioconductor,
see [@sec-resources]. In this book, we start by introducing the
material and link to further resources for learning R and
Bioconductor. We describe the key data infrastructure, the
`TreeSummarizedExperiment` class that provides a container for
microbiome data, and how to get started by loading microbiome data set
in the context of this new framework. After becoming familiar with data
containers and data importing, the book covers the common steps in
microbiome data analysis,
beginning with the most common steps and progressing to more
specialized methods in subsequent sections. *Workflows*,
provides case studies for the various datasets used throughout the
book. For hands-on practice, the *Training* section provides comprehensive
training resources. Finally, *Appendix*, links to further resources and
acknowledgments.

## Building OMA book {#sec-building-oma}

This book is automatically built to ensure that all code examples are functional.
See [@sec-session-info] for details.

In addition to accessing this book online, you can copy and paste the executable
code examples to run on your local computer. For package installation
instructions, refer to [@sec-packages]. You can also build and view the entire
book locally by following the steps provided
[here](https://github.com/microbiome/OMA?tab=readme-ov-file#deployment), or
use Docker image [@sec-docker-image].
