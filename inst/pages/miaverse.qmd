This chapter provides an overview of the miaverse ecosystem.
[@sec-data-containers] aims to describe the relationship between data containers
utilized in miaverse. [@sec-packages] details the packages involved, while
[@sec-installation] provides guidance on installing these packages.

miaverse (MIcrobiome Analysis uniVERSE) is an actively developed R/Bioconductor
framework for microbiome downstream analysis. It becomes particularly relevant
when working with abundance tables derived from sequencing data, whether from
shotgun metagenomics or 16S rRNA sequencing. Before utilizing miaverse,
sequencing data must undergo preprocessing to convert raw sequence reads into
abundance tables.

miaverse consists of multiple R/Bioc packages and this online book that you are
reading. The idea is not only to offer tools for microbiome downstream analysis
but also to serve as a resource for valuable insights, offering guidance on
conducting microbiome data analysis and developing effective microbiome data
science workflows.

The key concept of miaverse lies in its utilization of
`SummarizedExperiment`-based data containers. This design choice enhances
interoperability and versatility within the broader Bioconductor framework,
facilitating access to an expanding array of tools. In practice, this approach
allows for the integration of promising methods from related fields, such as
single-cell sequencing.

## Data containers {#sec-data-containers}

As discussed, miaverse is built upon `TreeSummarizedExperiment (TreeSE)` data
container. `TreeSummarizedExperiment` is expanded from
`SingleCellExperiment (SCE)` by incorporating additional slots tailored for
microbiome analysis.
`SingleCellExperiment` class which is designed for single-cell sequencing
[@R_SingleCellExperiment]. Bioconductor offers wide variety of tools for this
field including online book Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis in Bioconductor
(OSCA) [@Amezquita2020]. `SingleCellExperiment`, on the other hand, is further
derived from `SummarizedExperiment (SE)` class. This hierarchical relationship
among data containers means that all methods applicable to `SingleCellExperiment` and
`SummarizedExperiment` objects can also be applied to `TreeSummarizedExperiment`
objects.

- `SummarizedExperiment` (`SE`) [@R_SummarizedExperiment] is a generic and
highly optimized container for complex data
structures. It has become a common choice for analyzing various types
of biomedical profiling data, such as RNAseq, ChIp-Seq, microarrays,
flow cytometry, proteomics, and single-cell
sequencing.

- `SingeCellExperiment` (`SCE`) [@R_SingleCellExperiment] was developed as
an extension to store copies of data to same data container.

- `TreeSummarizedExperiment` (`TreeSE`) [@R_TreeSummarizedExperiment] was
developed as an extension to incorporate hierarchical
information (such as phylogenetic trees and sample hierarchies) and
reference sequences.

```{r}
#| label: TreeSE-figure
#| fig-cap: SummarizedExperiment is extended to SingleCellExperiment and it is further extended to TreeSummarizedExperiment.
#| fig-width: 4
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot() +
    theme_void() +  # Remove axis and background
    annotate("text", x = c(1, 2, 3), y = 1, label = c("SE", "SCE", "TreeSE"), size = 6) +
    annotate(
        "segment", x = c(1+0.25, 2+0.25),
        xend = c(2-0.25, 3-0.25), y = 1, yend = 1,
        arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "inches"), type = "closed"))
p + expand_limits(x = c(0.75, 3.25))
```

`MultiAssayExperiment` (`MAE`) [@Ramos2017] provides an organized
way to bind several different data containers together in a single
object. For example, we can bind microbiome data (in `TreeSE`
container) with metabolomic profiling data (in `SE`) container, with
(partially) shared sample metadata. This is convenient and robust for
instance, in subsetting and other data manipulation tasks. Microbiome
data can be part of multiomics experiments and analysis strategies. We
highlight how the methods used throughout in this book relate to this
data framework by using the `TreeSE`,
`MAE`, and classes beyond.

## Package ecosystem {#sec-packages}

Methods for the`(Tree)SummarizedExperiment` and `MultiAssayExperiment`
data containers are provided by multiple independent developers
through R/Bioconductor packages. Some of these are listed below (tips
on new packages are [welcome](https://microbiome.github.io)).

Especially, Bioconductor packages include comprehensive manuals as they are
required. Follow the links below to find package vignettes and other materials
showing the utilization of packages and their methods.

### mia package family

The mia package family provides general methods for microbiome data wrangling,
analysis and visualization.

- [mia](https://microbiome.github.io/mia/): Microbiome analysis tools [@R_mia]
- [miaViz](https://microbiome.github.io/miaViz/): Microbiome analysis specific visualization [@Ernst2022]
- [miaSim](https://microbiome.github.io/miaSim/): Microbiome data simulations [@Simsek2021]
- [miaTime](https://microbiome.github.io/miaTime/): Microbiome time series analysis [@Lahti2021]

### SE supporting packages {#sec-sub-diff-abund}

The following DA methods support `(Tree)SummarizedExperiment`.

- [ANCOMBC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ANCOMBC.html) for differential abundance analysis
- [benchdamic](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/benchdamic/inst/doc/intro.html) for benchmarking differential abundance methods
- [ALDEx2](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ALDEx2.html) for differential abundance analysis

- [Tools for Microbiome Analysis](https://microsud.github.io/Tools-Microbiome-Analysis/)
site listed over 130 R packages for microbiome data science in 2023. 
Many of these are not in Bioconductor, or do not directly support the
data containers  used in this book but can be often used with minor
modifications. The phyloseq-based tools can be used by converting the
TreeSE data into phyloseq with `convertToPhyloseq`.

### Open microbiome data 

Hundreds of published microbiome datasets are readily available in
these data containers (see [@sec-example-data]).

## Installation {#sec-installation}

### Installing all packages

You can install all packages that are required to run every example in this
book via the following command:

```{r}
#| label: install_packages
#| eval: FALSE
remotes::install_github("microbiome/OMA", dependencies = TRUE, upgrade = TRUE)
```

Optionally, you can install all packages or just certain ones with the following
script.

```{r}
#| label: all_packages
#| eval: FALSE
#| 

# URL of the raw CSV file on GitHub. It includes all packages needed.
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microbiome/OMA/devel/oma_packages/oma_packages.csv"

# Read the CSV file directly into R
df <- read.csv(url)
packages <- df[[1]]

# Get packages that are already installed installed
packages_already_installed <- packages[ packages %in% installed.packages() ]

# Get packages that need to be installed
packages_need_to_install <- setdiff( packages, packages_already_installed )

# Loads BiocManager into the session. Install it if it not already installed.
if( !require("BiocManager") ){
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    library("BiocManager")
}

# If there are packages that need to be installed, installs them with BiocManager
# Updates old packages.
if( length(packages_need_to_install) > 0 ) {
   install(packages_need_to_install, ask = FALSE)
}

# Load all packages into session. Stop if there are packages that were not
# successfully loaded
pkgs_not_loaded <- !sapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
pkgs_not_loaded <- names(pkgs_not_loaded)[ pkgs_not_loaded ]
if( length(pkgs_not_loaded) > 0 ){
    stop("Error in loading the following packages into the session: '", paste0(pkgs_not_loaded, collapse = "', '"), "'")
}
```

### Installing specific packages {#sec-packages_specific}

You can install R packages of your choice with the following procedures.

**Bioconductor release version** is the most stable and tested version but may
miss some of the latest methods and updates.

```{r}
#| label: bioc_release
#| eval: FALSE
BiocManager::install("microbiome/mia")
```


**Bioconductor development version** requires the installation of the
latest R beta version. This is primarily recommended for those who
already have experience with R/Bioconductor and need access to the
latest updates.

```{r}
#| label: bioc_devel
#| eval: FALSE
BiocManager::install("microbiome/mia", version = "devel")
```

**Github development version** provides access to the latest but
potentially unstable features. This is useful when you want access to
all available tools.

```{r}
#| label: github
#| eval: FALSE
devtools::install_github("microbiome/mia")
```
