Data transformations are common in (microbial) ecology [@Legendre2001]
and used to improve compatibility with assumptions related to specific
statistical methods, mitigate biases, enhance the comparability of
samples, or features, or to obtain more interpretable values.

Examples include the logarithmic transformation, the calculation of
relative abundances (percentages), and compositionality-aware
transformations such as the centered log-ratio transformation (clr).

## Characteristics of microbiome data {#sec-stat-challenges}

Microbiome sequencing data has unique characteristics that must be addressed;
otherwise, incorrect decisions might be made based on the results.
Specifically, microbiome sequencing data is
characterized by high variability, zero-inflation and compositionality.
**High variability** expresses that abundance of taxa often varies by several
orders of magnitude from sample to sample. **Zero-inflation** means that
typically more than 70% of the values are zeros, which could be due to either
physical absence (structural zeros) or insufficient sampling effort (sampling
zeros). **Compositionality** means that a change in the absolute abundance of
one taxon will lead to apparent variations in the relative abundances of other
taxa in the same sample. If neglected, such properties may cause significant
bias in the results of DAA or other statistical tests. Therefore, several
approaches have been developed to address the unique properties of microbiome
data and provide statistically reliable results.

## Common transformation methods

Let us now summarize some commonly used transformations in microbiome data
science; further details and benchmarkings available in the
references.

 * 'relabundance' Relative transformation, also known as total sum
   scaling (TSS) and compositional transformation. This converts
   counts into percentages (at the scale [0, 1]) that sum up to
   1. Much of the currently available taxonomic abundance data from
   high-throughput assays (16S, metagenomic sequencing) is
   compositional by nature, even if the data is provided as counts
   [@Gloor2017].
 
 * 'clr' Centered log ratio transformation [@Aitchison1986] is used to
   reduce data skewness and compositionality bias in relative
   abundances, while bringing the data to the logarithmic scale. This
   transformation is frequently applied in microbial ecology
   [@Gloor2017]. However, this transformation only applies to positive
   values. Usual solution is to add pseudocount, which adds another
   type of bias in the data. The robust clr transformation ('rclr')
   aims to circumvent the need to add a pseudocount. While the
   resulting values from these transformations are difficult interpret
   directly, this transformation may enhance comparability of relative
   differences between samples. It is part of a broader Aitchison
   family of transformations; the additive log ratio transformation
   (`alr') is also available. The robust clr ("rclr") is similar to
   regular clr (see above) but allows data with zeroes and avoids the
   need to add pseudocount [@Keshavan2010, @Martino2019].

  * 'pa' Presence/Absence transformation ignores abundances and only
   indicates whether the given feature is detected above the given
   threshold (default: 0). This simple transformation is relatively
   widely used in ecological research. It has shown good performance
   in microbiome-based classification performance [@Giliberti2022,
   Karwowska2024].

 * 'standardize' Standardize(or 'z-score') transformation scales data to zero
   mean and unit variance. This is used to bring features (or samples) to more 
   comparable levels in terms of mean and scale of the values. This can enhance
   visualization and interpretation of the data

* 'log', 'log2', 'log10' Logarithmic transformations, used e.g. to
   reduce data skewness. With compositional data, the `clr` (or `rclr`)
   transformation is often preferred.
   
 * 'hellinger' Hellinger transformation is equal to the square root of
   relative abundances. This ecological transformation can be useful
   if we are interested in changes in relative abundances.

 * 'rank' Rank transformation replaces each value by its rank. Also
   see 'rrank' (relative rank transformation). This has use, for
   instance, in non-parametric statistics.

 * Other available transformations include Chi square ('chi.square'),
   Frequency transformation ('frequency'), and Make margin sum of
   squares equal to one ('normalize')

Transformations on abundance assays can be performed with
`mia::transformAssay()`, keeping both the original and the transformed
assay(s). The transformed abundance assay is then stored back to the
'assays' slot in the data object. The function applies sample-wise or
column-wise transformation when MARGIN = 'cols', feature-wise or
row-wise transformation when MARGIN = 'rows'.

A complete list of available transformations and parameters, is
available in the function
[help](https://microbiome.github.io/mia/reference/transformAssay.html).

Pseudocount is a small non-negative value added to the normalized data to avoid 
taking the logarithm of zero. It's value can have a significant impact on the results when applying 
a logarithm transformation to normalized data, as the logarithm transformation 
is a nonlinear operation that can fundamentally change the data distribution [@Costea2014].


Pseudocount should be chosen consistently across all normalization methods being 
compared, for example, by setting it to a value smaller than the minimum abundance 
value before transformation. Some tools, like ancombc2, take into account the effect 
of the pseudocount by performing sensitivity tests using multiple pseudocount 
values. See [@sec-differential-abundance].

## Transformations in practice

```{r}
# Load example data
library(mia)
data("GlobalPatterns", package = "mia")
tse <- GlobalPatterns

# Transform "counts" assay to relative abundances ("relabundance"), with
# pseudocount 1 
tse <- transformAssay(
     tse, assay.type = "counts", method = "relabundance", pseudocount = 1)

# Transform relative abundance assay ("relabundance") to "clr", using
# pseudocount if necessary; name the resulting assay to "clr" 
tse <- transformAssay(
    x = tse, assay.type = "relabundance", method = "clr", pseudocount = TRUE,
    name = "clr")

```

Get the values in the resulting assay, and view some of the first
entries of it with the `head` command.

```{r}
head(assay(tse, "clr"))
```

In 'pa' transformation, abundance table is converted to
presence/absence table that ignores abundances and only indicates
whether the given feature is detected. This simple transformation is
relatively widely used in ecological research. It has shown good
performance in microbiome-based classification performance
[@Giliberti2022, Karwowska2024].

```{r}
# Here, `assay.type` is not explicitly specified.
# Then The function uses the "counts" assay for the transformation.
tse <- transformAssay(tse, method = "pa")
head(assay(tse, "pa"))
```

You can now view the entire list of abundance assays in your data object with:

```{r}
assays(tse)
```

- Compositional
- High variability
- Zero-inflated
